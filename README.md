## Description
    This is just me trying to build a website based on an existing website which for which I have included the link below.  This site is just me practicing what I have learned and trying to reproduce an existing website, maybe with some tweaks and using react.  nt all features will be available as this is just a test and not the actual site...all photos belong to the owner of the original site.
