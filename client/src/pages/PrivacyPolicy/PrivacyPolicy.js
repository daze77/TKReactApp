            <strong>Commitment to privacy</strong>
            <p>As a valued customer, protecting your privacy is important to Tony Koukos World Travel Photography. As part of our commitment to privacy protection, we have implemented this Privacy Policy to inform you of the way we manage your Personal Information. By using this website you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <strong>What is "Personal Information"?</strong>
            <p>"Personal Information" is information about you as an individual. Examples include your name, mailing and e-mail addresses, telephone number and credit card information.</p>

            <strong>Collection and Use of Personal Information</strong>
            <p>We may collect personal information from you in the following circumstances: when you make an online purchase from our website; when you sign up to receive our e-mail newsletter; when you take advantage of special services offered by us; when you enter a contest or other promotion through this Website or by regular mail; or when you contact us to make requests or comment on our services.</p>

            <p>We also use your personal information for our own internal purposes, such as providing customer support or providing, maintaining, evaluating and improving our products and services.</p>

            <strong>Disclosure of Personal Information</strong>
            <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. We will not disclose your Personal Information unless required by law in response to a search warrant or other legally valid enquiry. We use your Personal Information for internal purposes only. We do not sell, rent or trade in Personal Information.</p>

            <p>You may, from time to time, receive information from us about new features, new services and special offers we think you'll find valuable. If you take advantage of special offers made by our marketing partners, we may, with your consent, transfer your personal information to them. We may share your mailing address with select third parties.</p>

            <p>Third parties have separate and independent privacy policies. Tony Koukos World Travel Photography has no control over third party privacy policies and therefore has no responsibility or liability for the manner in which third parties may collect, use, disclose or otherwise treat your personal information.</p>

            <p>We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of such other websites.</p>

            <p>We partner with one or more credit card processing companies to assist us in processing your payment. However, those companies do not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p>

            <p>We may disclose the personal and non-personal information of our customers to any successor-in-interest of ours, such as a company that acquires our business.</p>

            <strong>Choosing to Opt-out of Certain Communications</strong>
            <p>If you are no longer interested in receiving e-mail announcements or other marketing information from us, please e-mail your request to info@tonykoukos.com. Please include your complete name, e-mail address and mailing address. Note that you may still receive customer service related communications from us.</p>

            <strong>IP Address and Cookies</strong>
            <p>In addition, like almost all e-commerce web sites, we use a browser feature known as a â€œcookie." Cookies are bits of information that are stored on your computer by your web browser. Although our cookies don't store any of your personal information, they do allow us to do things like keep items in your shopping cart between visits or during the same visit or provide you with a more personalized user experience.</p>

            <p>Most browser software allows you to delete cookies. You should consult your Internet service provider for information on how to delete cookies. This may interfere with our ability to personalize your experience at our Website and be recognized, or may slow down performance.</p>

            <strong>How We Protect Your Information</strong>
            <p>The security of your personal information is very important to us. That is why we protect and safeguard your Personal Information. Our security policies govern the protection of the information on our information systems, the way we protect our Website from malicious attack, and the way in which we dispose of information no longer needed.</p>

            <p>When you enter sensitive information such as a credit card number on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). For purchases made online with credit cards, we store your credit card number in encrypted form for a limited amount of time, and our employees do not have access to this information. We do not store PIN data or 3-digit security codes.</p>

            <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us from unauthorized access or disclosure, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We assume no liability for any disclosure of data due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third party access or other acts of third parties, or other acts or omissions.</p>
