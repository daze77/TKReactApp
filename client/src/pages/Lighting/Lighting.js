            <p>Custom lighting and lampshades are available for all your design projects. Any images on Tony Koukos World Travel Photography, Koukos Wallcoverings and 
                Art & Design can be customized into shades. Images from The Gallery Collection are limited to only art in editions of 24.

            <p>Clients can also provide images or fabric to have your own custom shades made. Give your existing lamps a new look by replacing the shade with a 
                customized art shade. Images are printed on an eco-poly fabric then mounted to a flexible backing, and available up to a diameter of a 36” drum shade. 
                Light diffusers (frosted acrylic cutouts) are available to soften direct light. Shades can be used with a standard cord set available at major retailers 
                around the world.
